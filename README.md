Hello, I am very happy to announce the grand Soccer 3.0 beta 1. This repo will have the whole Soccer 3 series. Thanks to a few people for some code.

###                                                            ***INSTRUCTIONS TO PLAY***

**Player 1 - W,A,S,D KEYS**

**Player 2 - UP,LEFT,DOWN,RIGHT KEYS**

**TRY TO THROW THE BALL INTO THE GOAL. THE BALL DOESN'T NEED TO BE KICKED AS IT BOUNCES OFF WHEN THE PLAYER TOUCHES IT.**

This game has many bugs but will be fixed in upcoming beta and stable updates.
